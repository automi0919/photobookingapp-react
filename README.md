# Photo Booking App

This is a full-stack React App built with the MERN stack that allows realtors to schedule photo shoots of homes they're selling with participating photographers. Photographers can set and control availability, and view their appointments via a React package called EJ2 Scheduler.

Authentication is currently handled via Bcrypt.

The app also leverages the Mashvisor API that looks up and returns the square-footage of a property to be photographed. This square-footage is used to determine the price and package of the particular photo shoot.

This is an on-going personal project that is in active development.
